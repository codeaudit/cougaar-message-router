Version 1.5
30 Apr 04
Changed the mechanism for detecting if a client connection is closed so that the connection monitor will not erroneously delete a client connection object before it is fully closed.
29 Apr 04
Modified the ConnectionRegistry::findConnection() method so that it checks the count of registered connections for a given name before trying to retrieve the connection.  This is because the reference mechanism in the std::map class will create a default object of one does not exist upon dereference.  
Placed the MessageSender::sendMessage() method in a semaphore block to prevent thread contention.
28 Apr 04 
Modified to prevent duplicate user ids from being connected at the same time.
